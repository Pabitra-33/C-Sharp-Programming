# C# Programming Practice 

## 📚 Overview
A comprehensive collection of C# programming exercises, algorithms, data structures, and practical implementations designed to enhance C# development skills. This repository serves as both a learning resource and a reference guide for C# best practices, patterns, and modern language features.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Practice and master C# programming concepts

- Implement common algorithms and data structures in C#

- Explore .NET features and best practices

- Prepare for technical interviews

- Build reusable code snippets and utilities

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-> .NET 6/7/8/10 - Cross-platform development framework

-> C# 10/11 - Modern language features

-> xUnit/NUnit - Unit testing frameworks

-> BenchmarkDotNet - Performance benchmarking

-> LINQPad - Interactive C# scratchpad

## 📖 Learning Path

#### Beginner Level

-> Basic syntax and control structures

-> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles

-> Collections and generics

-> Exception handling

-> File I/O operations

#### Intermediate Level

-> Advanced LINQ queries

-> Asynchronous programming (async/await)

-> Delegates, events, and lambdas

-> Extension methods

-> Reflection and attributes

#### Advanced Level

-> Design patterns implementation

-> Memory management and performance

-> Parallel programming

#### Advanced data structures

-> Algorithm optimization

## 💡 Practice Areas

#### Algorithms:
-> Sorting algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort, etc.)

-> Search algorithms (Binary, Linear, etc.)

-> Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra)

-> Dynamic programming problems

-> Recursion and backtracking

#### Data Structures
-> Arrays, Lists, Dictionaries

-> Stacks, Queues, Deques

-> Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)

 ->Trees (Binary, AVL, Red-Black)
 
-> Heaps and Priority Queues

## C# Specific Features

-> LINQ to Objects, XML, SQL

-> Async/Await patterns

-> Expression trees

-> Pattern matching

-> Records and init-only properties

-> Source generators

## 🧪 Testing

-> Each implementation includes unit tests to verify correctness:


# Run all tests
```
dotnet test
```
# Run specific test project
```
dotnet test ./Tests/AlgorithmTests
```

## 📈 Performance
Some solutions include benchmarking using BenchmarkDotNet:
```
csharp
[MemoryDiagnoser]
public class SortingBenchmarks
{
    // Benchmark methods here
}
```

📝 Code Style Guidelines
Use meaningful variable and method names

Follow C# naming conventions (PascalCase for methods, camelCase for variables)

Add XML documentation comments for public members

Keep methods focused and single-responsibility

Use var when type is obvious from right-hand side

Prefer expression-bodied members for simple methods
